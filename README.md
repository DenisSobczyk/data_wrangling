# data_wrangling
**Introduction**
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.
Project Details
Your tasks in this project are as follows:
Data wrangling, which consists of:
Gathering data (downloadable file in the Resources tab in the left most panel of your classroom and linked in step 1 below).
Assessing data
Cleaning data
Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations
**Project Motivation**
After assessing all files for the first time, I found out that I wanted to know more about each dog type and their given names. As I am very new to this particular field (confession: I do not have a dog) I wanted to know what species of dogs are the most popular posted on twitter. Moreover, I was pretty courious about the most popular dog names, having actually several ones i mind.
